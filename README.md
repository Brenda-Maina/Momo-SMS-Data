## Project Description
This project builds an enterprise-style fullstack application to process and analyze MoMo SMS transaction data. The system ingests raw MoMo SMS XML files, extracts transaction fields, cleans and normalizes timestamps, phone numbers and amounts, and categorizes transactions (e.g., inflow, outflow). Processed records are stored in a SQLite database and aggregated into a `dashboard.json` file used by a lightweight HTML/JS dashboard to display charts and transaction tables.

The project emphasizes a reproducible ETL pipeline, clean data handling, collaborative development (Codespaces, branching, PRs), and an architecture that supports adding a REST API (FastAPI) for integrations.
